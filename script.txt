1. Intro slide
We're going to do a quickfire Python quiz, the way it's going to work is:
 - I'll show a code snippet
 - You decide if it's valid Python or not
 - I'll count down
 - Everyone raise their hand - open hand for valid, closed hand for invalid
 - Follow your instinct, it'll have to be quick
Note that I haven't customised the Python.

2. f-strings
First snippet - is it valid (open) or invalid (closed)?
3, 2, 1, vote!
Ok, this is valid - the first example was introduced in Python3.6 released 3 years ago, the second is a new debug f-string being released in 3.8 (in beta)

3. Cancel threads
Next question...
3, 2, 1, vote!
Not valid - you can't cancel threads. To achieve something like this you can use async-await or a library like curio.

4. Generators
... 3, 2, 1, vote!
Not valid - the array in the 'if' part is lazy-evaluated.

5. Positional-only arguments
... 3, 2, 1, vote!
Valid in Python3.8 - new positional-only arguments, useful when the names have no meaning.

6. Walrus operator
... 3, 2, 1, vote!
Another new feature in Python3.8 - assignment operator (aka walrus operator). Caused a lot of disagreement in the Python community, leading to Guido stepping down as BDFL.

7. Import bash
... 3, 2, 1, vote!
This works! But only because I hacked in an import hook silently when I imported 're' earlier on.
 - My version of re.py is used because the cwd appears first in sys.path.
 - My version of re.py temporarily removes the cwd from sys.path to ensure the real 're' is imported and returned.
 - It then installs the import hook by appending to sys.meta_path.


Everyone should be using Python3 by now! It was first released more than 10 years ago, and Python2 will only be supported until January 1st!
